# Workshops_Home

## Getting Started:
- Install Python or a C compiler for your system:
  - For C on Windows, I recommend using the MSVC compiler which you can install thru Visual Studio.
  - For C on Mac/Linux, you can install gcc or clang.
- Download and setup raylib for your system:
  - For C, I recommend installing a release of raylib from this page in the "Assets" section: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/5.5
  - For Python, follow the installation instructions here: https://pypi.org/project/raylib/
