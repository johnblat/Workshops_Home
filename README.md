## Getting Started:
- Install Python or a C compiler for your system:
  - C:
    - on Windows, I recommend using the MSVC compiler which you can install thru Visual Studio.
    - on Mac/Linux, you can install gcc or clang.
  - Python:
    - On Mac/Linux, python should already be installed by default, and might be able to be called on the command line with `python` or `python3`
    - For Windows, you will have to install python for your system    
    - Install raylib thru pip for your system:
      - follow the installation instructions here: https://pypi.org/project/raylib/
    

 
## TODO:
- Convert finished repo into workshop:
  - Tic Tac Toe:
    - Odin Code: https://github.com/johnblat/TicTacToe_Odin

  - Breakout
