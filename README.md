# Workshops_Home

## Getting Started:
- Install Python or a C compiler for your system:
  - C:
    - on Windows, I recommend using the MSVC compiler which you can install thru Visual Studio.
    - on Mac/Linux, you can install gcc or clang.
  -  Python:
    - On Mac/Linux, python should already be installed by default, and might be able to be called on the command line with `python` or `python3`
    - For Windows, you will have to install python for your system    
- Download and setup raylib for your system:
  - For C, I recommend installing a release of raylib from this page in the "Assets" section: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/5.5
    - ^ I've actually included the raylib libraries for Snake and Pong C repos so far so you don't have to download it yourself. 
  - For Python, follow the installation instructions here: https://pypi.org/project/raylib/
